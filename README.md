###Makers Craftathon

One day of crafting code with employer clients. It's not a hackathon because the code must be test driven and beautiful.

###Brief

Makers Academy is going to space!

- Evgeny and Ruben have gotten ballsier and have decided to rent a spaceship to take 8 passengers on a 12-week round trip to the moon.

Your Mission: Launch a website allowing people to book tickets.

###Job stories for the user

```
When I visit the website
I want to experience a well made website
So that I can place my trust in the business

When I'm booking my next holiday
I want to reserve a window seat
So that I can enjoy a beautiful view of the galaxy
```

###Job stories for the owner

```
When I figure out how much to charge
I want to be able to set the price per ticket
So that users know how much it costs

When I log in to my dashboard
I want to see who has reserved seats on Makers Galactic I
So that I can know if my MVP worked

When I have a full spaceship
I want the site to show the flight as full
So that it doesn't get overbooked

When I fill my first flight
I want to take reservations for my next flight
So that I can make this business a success
```

We would like to see well crafted, test-driven code and a well thought out, slick UX/UI.
